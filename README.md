# BirdsFlockSimulation
Simulation of the birds flocking behaviour in R.

In this repository the bird flocking behaviour is simulated. For this goal appropriate class representing the system was created and algorithms
guaranteeing alignment, cohesion and separation, processes observed in the nature, are implemented. Finally, the visualization of the simulation
using gganimate library is performed what can be watched in the .gif files.
